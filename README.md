project UI is from Disney website 


here in HEAD section we uses remixicon for getting the icons .
now in HEADER part we use display as grid (justify content , align item etc. etc. )
in LOOK part ( banner )we simply uses only width :100%
in CARD section we again uses flex (we have 2 option either flex or grid)..... and given the proper height , width , margin , padding also given to hover effect too (transform & transition ) for when we hover on it it will show the effect (scale)
in FUTURE section again we uses the flex with desired height , width , margin , padding also same css is uses in HOLIDAY and MORE section
same again in FOOTER section
